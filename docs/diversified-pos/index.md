# Diversified PoS â€” Tenet

Proof of Stake is now cemented as the preferred consensus model for new blockchain adopters. The reduced fees and increased scalability it brings enable powerful smart contract economies. As a bonus, its low carbon impact appeals to corporations and mass media, which boost the odds of accelerated mainstream adoption.

There has been, however, little innovation in Proof of Stake models.

Tenet introduces a novel Proof of Stake framework which retains all of its benefits while increasing security compared to legacy PoS models. This is the dawn of Diversified Proof of Stake (DiPoS).
