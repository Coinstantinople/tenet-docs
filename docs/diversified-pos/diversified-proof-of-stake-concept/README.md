# Diversified Proof of Stake Concept

Staking is a process of locking up a crypto asset to provide economic stability and power the block production of a proof-of-stake blockchain. By default, PoS blockchains support only one asset for staking, known as the native asset.&#x20;

Diversified Proof of Stake enables multiple assets to be staked on a blockchain. With Diversified Proof of Stake, assets from one chain can be staked on another, creating a mutually beneficial economic partnership through interchain staking. All chains benefit from the cross-chain relationship, providing users with a wider range of diverse assets and yield opportunities.
