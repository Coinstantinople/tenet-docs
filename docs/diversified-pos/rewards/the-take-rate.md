# The Take Rate

In addition to the native rewards mentioned above, the Diversified Proof of Stake module introduces a third source of rewards, called the Take Rate. The Take Rate is an optional (it can be set to 0 by governance) annualized tax applied to each Diversified Proof of Stake asset. When the Take Rate is applied to a staked Diversified Proof of Stake asset, the proceeds are distributed to veTenet holders.

The Take Rate is designed to be used with Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) and is denominated in the asset from which it was derived. This feature provides additional rewards to veTenet holders.
