# Source of Staking Rewards

The TENET blockchain generates staking rewards from two sources:

* Inflation rewards: These are new native tokens that are minted and released as rewards every block according to the chain's inflation rate.
* Gas fees: These are the computational transaction fees applied to every blockchain transaction. 50% of these fees go to stakers and 50% to veTenet holders.



Because gas and inflation are denominated in a chain's native asset, Diversified Proof of Stake stakers will receive native rewards in the form of the TENET native asset.
