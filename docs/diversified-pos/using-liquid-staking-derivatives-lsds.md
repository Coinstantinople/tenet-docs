# Using Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs)

The Tenet basket of validation assets uses Proof of Stake assets. Therefore, Tenet accepts liquid staking derivatives such as those minted via protocols like Lido and RocketPool or even institutions like Binance and Coinbase.

LSDs like stETH and cbETH can be used to participate in Tenet validation and earn network transaction fees, while still earning the ETH staking yield that the LSDs offer.

These LSDs are easy to capture as there is often low demand for them. They are just held in wallets. Tenet offers LSD holders a significant additional opportunity for yield: a value swap of Tenet block rewards and transaction fees for boosted security (of the Tenet network).

LSD holders can become Tenet validators or delegators to other nodes. They can then continue to earn their yield while earning a second layer of income through the block rewards and transaction fees building up on Tenet. Over $25B is held in LSDs. This is the immediate go-to market for Tenet’s Diversified PoS adoption.

Tenet also provides its own inhouse infrastructure for LSDs. Liquify your staked position on ETH, ATOM, BNB, MATIC, ADA, and DOT through Tenet’s liquid staking protocol. Skip the 10% management fee charged by protocols like Lido.

For Tenet, acquisition of these assets isn’t for monetary purposes but for security. Therefore, a zero fee is simply a form of security incentivization. This allows Tenet to gather new LSD minters en masse by offering both the highest yield in native assets and additional value through its own network fees.
