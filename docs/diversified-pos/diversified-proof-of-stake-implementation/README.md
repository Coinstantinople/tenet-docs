# Diversified Proof of Stake Implementation

The Cosmos SDK is a framework for building blockchains that has been extensively battle-tested and is extremely powerful. It provides a customizable and modular infrastructure that can be leveraged to create innovative blockchain features, such as Diversified Proof of Stake, without requiring the development of an entire blockchain architecture from scratch.

The Diversified Proof of Stake logic can be implemented as an additional module to a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain, without requiring changes to consensus or major modifications to core modules.This module wraps around a chain's native staking module, enabling whitelisted assets to be staked and earn rewards.\
