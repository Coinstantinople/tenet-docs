# Adding new LSDs as Diversified Proof of Stake assets

Once the Diversified Proof of Stake module is activated, native stakers can decide which assets they want to add to the blockchain. A proposal can then be created and submitted to the blockchain's governance system. This proposal contains a title, description, and the following information:

* The denomination of the asset to be added.
* A Take Rate: a tax that redistributes a percentage of the staking rewards from the asset to veTenet holders.



Once the proposal is approved by the governance system, the asset becomes a Diversified Proof of Stake asset, which can be staked by users to start earning rewards.
