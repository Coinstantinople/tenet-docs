# What assets can be staked?

Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) from other chains can be staked on a chain with the Diversified Proof of Stake module. Once staked, the asset starts accruing staking rewards. Like native staking assets, Diversified Proof of Stake assets can be staked, unstaked, or redelegated to different validators. They are also subject to an unbonding period after unstaking. Staking a Diversified Proof of Stake asset is as seamless as staking a native asset for the user.
