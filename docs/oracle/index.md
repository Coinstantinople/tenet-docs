# Welcome to Tenet Oracle

Tenet Oracle in its first instance is based upon the Chainlink oracle codebase with certain changes necessary for utilisation in Tenet's native products, including the calculation of price feeds for tLSD assets based on the price feed for an underlying LSD asset. 

In these docs we will cover the base Chainlink oracle implementastion as well as the changes implemented for the Tenet Oracle solution. Chainlink oracle was a pivotal innovation in the blockchain landscape that bridged the gap between smart contracts and real-world data. Tenet Oracle takes this concept to the next level for utilisation within Tenet's LSDfi ecosystem.

## What is Tenet Oracle?

Tenet Oracle is a decentralized oracle network, a critical layer in Tenet's LSDfi infrastructure that provides reliable, tamper-proof inputs and outputs for complex smart contracts on Tenet. It extends the functionality of Chainlink to Tenet network and the LSDfi ecosystem built on top of it.

## Key Features

- **Reliable Data Feeds:** Tenet Oracle provides a network of decentralized oracles that supply accurate and real-time data from various sources.
- **Seamless Connectivity:** It connects smart contracts with off-chain data and services, expanding their potential far beyond on-chain capabilities.
- **Proven Node Operators:** Tenet Oracle will utilise a subset of Tenet's professional validator network, including existing Chainlink Node Operators, to ensure high-quality and secure node operation and trustworthy data delivery.
