### Layer Zero
LayerZero is an omnichain interoperability protocol designed for efficient message transmission across different blockchains.
It offers reliable and guaranteed message delivery with adjustable levels of trustlessness.
[Layer Zero](https://layerzero.network) is pioneering new applications in the DeFi sector, including trading, borrowing, and lending across various blockchains, leading to more streamlined markets.
Also, gaming and media dApps can execute high-volume transactions on a single blockchain, while also having the capability to transfer, purchase, and sell NFTs on other blockchains with the most liquid markets.

### OFT
TENET has adopted the Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard from Layer Zero Labs, which brings a significant advantage for interoperability across blockchains.
OFT is an extensible token contract, paving the way for external composition of tokens across a wide array of dApps, irrespective of the DeFi ecosystem they belong to.
By adopting OFT tokens, a unified standard for all protocols and blockchains can be achieved.
This seamless integration enables users to effortlessly swap across chains and utilize the tokens on any dApp on any chain.
