# Governance

The Tenet DeFi ecosystem is governed by the validator network, which also governs the Tenet blockchain base layer.

veTENET holders are still able to participate in governance just like tTENET holders by the following actions:

1. Change the vote attached to their veTENET if they disagree with the validators vote (for example if the validator votes yes, a veTENET holder with TENET delegated to that validator can change their vote to no); and
2. Change the validator to which their TENET are staked - in this case the underlying TENET will be moved to a new validator and the previous veTENET will be replaced with a new veTENET showing the correct validator delegation.
