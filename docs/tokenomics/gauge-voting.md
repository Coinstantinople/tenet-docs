# Gauge Voting

veTENET owners have voting power within the native gauge system of TENET.&#x20;

New TENET tokens are continuously emitted to various reward sinks to ensure healthy operation of the blockchain and the infrastructure built on top.&#x20;

veTENET owners decide where these newly created TENET tokens are distributed to.&#x20;

A gauge represents a reward sink where TENET tokens are sent to.&#x20;

At the top level of the system, we identify the following reward sinks:

* Block Rewards
* DeFi Protocol Incentives

### Block Rewards

Within this reward sink, there exists another round of voting.&#x20;

Each holder of a tLSD (and the validator to which they are delegated) will get TENET tokens allocated to it depending on his share of this second voting round and the original amount of TENET assigned to Block Rewards

### DeFi Protocol Incentives

DeFi protocols work better if they have sufficient liquidity. TENET tokens are used to incentivize capital to move to TENET DeFi protocols. Liquidity providers are rewarded with newly emitted TENET tokens as directed by veTENET owners.

The following protocols are eligible for Protocol Incentives in the following way:

* TENET Stablecoin Protocol
  * Stability Pool Depositors&#x20;
* TENET Money Market
  * Lending and Borrowing incentives - A secondary gauge vote is needed here to vote between the different markets.
* TENET Decentralized Exchange&#x20;
  * Liquidity Provider Rewards - A secondary gauge vote is needed here to vote between the different liquidity pairs.&#x20;

### Bribes

The gauge voting power that veTENET holds opens up the possibility for external protocols and Staking Providers to 'bribe' veTENET holders for their vote. This is an additional way for veTENET owners to earn income while creating a market for purchasing liquidity incentives on TENET.&#x20;
